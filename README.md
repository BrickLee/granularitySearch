# granularitySearch<br>
keywords: granularity, attribute reduction, granularity space<br>
  I just want to construct a heuristic algorithm which can get a attribute reduct of positive region preservation, generalize decision preservation, distribution preservation, maximal distribution preservation, relative indiscernibility preservation in Rough Sets theory. I name that algorithm granularity search.<br>
  In this project, I reproduce three existing classic heuristic attribute reduction algorithm in paper [1,2]. Then, I compare speed of my algorithm with existing algorithm. One more thing is that this algorithm I proposed can used to find reduct of maximal distribution preservation, relative indiscernibility preservation. It is simple, easy to acknowledge, and faster.<br>
  I hope you get you want and have fun in this project.<br>
