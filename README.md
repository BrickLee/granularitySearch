# granularitySearch
keywords: granularity, attribute reduction, granularity space<br>
  I just want construct a heuristic algorithm which can finding attribute reduct with positive region preservation, generalize decision preservation, distribution preservation, maximal distribution preservation, relative indiscernibility preservation in Rough Sets theory. I name that algorithm granularity search.
  In this project, I reproduce three existing classic heuristic attribute reduction algorithm in paper [1,2]. Then, I compare my algorithm speed with existing algorithm.
